abstract = {New technologies are emerging that capture and redirect sunlight inside solar cells. This type of light management can significantly increase efficiency, but the device behavior will fundamentally depend on the spatial coherence of the incoming light. This dependence calls for a complete characterization of the spatial coherence of sunlight. Here, we present the first spectral measurements of the spatial degree of coherence of direct, diffuse, and simulated sunlight. An expression is derived for both the cross-spectral density and the spatial degree of coherence in an arbitrarily oriented device plane, including the effects of overcast skies. Implications of the present work are discussed and may lead to a better understanding of light-managing components in solar cells as well as a new class of solar simulator that provides both the same spectrum and spatial coherence as direct sunlight.},

abstract = {From quantum point of view, Hanbury Brown-Twiss effect is a result of constructive-destructive two-photon interference. There should be no Hanbury Brown-Twiss effect if there was no two-photon interference. In this paper, we observed Hanbury Brown-Twiss effect in a specially designed experiment, in which two-photon interference is impossible by keeping only one two-photon probability amplitude in the experimental scheme. However, our experimental results can still be interpreted by Glauber's quantum optical coherence theory. The researches in our paper are helpful to understand the physics of the second-order coherence of light, especially the physics of Hanbury Brown-Twiss effect. Hanbury Brown-Twiss (HBT) effect, which is also known as two-photon bunching of thermal light, was first observed by Hanbury Brown and Twiss in 1956 1, 2 . At first, HBT interferometer was developed to measure the size of stars by studying the correlation of intensity fluctuations 2 . This method based on HBT interferometer would bring the improvement beyond the Michelson interferometer in measuring the size of stars. In their experiments, two photo-detectors are placed in the far field zone of a chaotic radiation source. The correlation between the sig-nals from the two detectors is measured. They found that independently emitted photons by thermal source were not really independent. Photons in thermal light have the tendency to come in bunches rather than randomly. To understand the results of observations, both quantum and classical theories were employed to interpret this strange phenomenon 3–7},

This lamp is used for several demonstration experiments concerning the relations between coherence and fluctuations: The intensity interferometer of Hanbury Brown and Twiss is applied to measure the correlations between intensity fluctuations. The double slit experiment of Young serves to stress the role of fluctuations for classical interferometry. Interference patterns from two independent quasithermal lamps are presented.},

abstract = {Two-photon superbunching of pseudothermal light is observed with single-mode continuous-wave laser light in a linear optical system. By adding more two-photon paths via three rotating ground glasses,g(2)(0) = 7.10 is experimentally observed. The second-order temporal coherence function of superbunching pseudothermal light is theoretically and experimentally studied in detail. It is predicted that the degree of coherence of light can be increased dramatically by adding more multi-photon paths. For instance, the degree of the second- and third-order coherence of the superbunching pseudothermal light with five rotating ground glasses can reach 32 and 7776, respectively. The results are helpful to understand the physics of superbunching and to improve the visibility of thermal light ghost imaging.},

abstract = {Wide field-of-view imaging of fast processes in a microscope requires high light intensities motivating the use of lasers as light sources. However, due to their long spatial coherence length lasers are inappropriate for such applications as they produce coherent noise and parasitic reflections, such as speckle, degrading image quality. Therefore, we provide a step-by-step guide for constructing a speckle-free and high contrast laser illumination setup using a rotating ground glass diffuser driven by a stepper motor. The setup is easy to build, cheap and allows a significant light throughput of 48 {\%}, which is 40 {\%} higher in comparison to a single lens collector commonly used in reported setups. This is achieved by using only one objective to collect the scattered light from the ground glass diffuser. We validate the stability and performance of our setup in terms of image quality, motor-induced vibrations and light throughput. To highlight the latter, we record Brownian motion of micro-particles using a 100x oil immersion objective and a high-speed camera operating at 2 000 Hz with a laser output power of only 22 mW. Moreover, by reducing the objective magnification to 50x sampling rates up to 10 000 Hz are realized. To help readers with basic or advanced optics knowledge realizing this setup we provide; a full component list, 3D-printing CAD files, setup protocol, and the code for running the stepper motor.},

abstract = {We report on an experimental demonstration of quantum imaging where the images are stored in both space and time. Quantum images of remote objects are produced with rotating ground glass induced chaotic laser light and two sensors measuring at different space-time points. Quantum images are observed to move depending on the time delay between the sensor measurements. The experiments provide a new testbed for exploring the time and space scale fundamental physics of quantum imaging and suggest new pathways for quantum information storage and processing. The moved quantum images are in fact new images that are stored in a space-time virtual memory process. The images are stored within the same quantum imaging data sets and thus quantum imaging can produce more information per photon measured than was previously realized. {\textcopyright} 2013 SPIE.},
